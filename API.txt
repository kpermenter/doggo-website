API 
• API = endpoint ==> full url
- everything is an endpoint
- url (full qualified domain)
- uri (part after domain)
    - domain is base path: stays the same
    - uri changes
- interface between enpoint (url/path) and code
- many websites code APIs for public consumption in dev documentation (give endpoints)

Terminology
• Post = sending || submitting || commit
    - i.e. commit repo
    - request returns JSON
    - create something new
• Get = fetch ==> gathers || retrieve
    - i.e. cloning repo
    - getting data from server
• Put = putting
    - updating something
• Delete = delete
• Patch = sending

Endpoint:
https://dog.ceo/api/breed/${breed}/images/random
{breed} = parameter

Headers.request
• info about request going out and coming back
    - get method for requests going out
    - to change to patch method ==> must be coded that way
    - patch vs. put method ==> depends on dev preference
